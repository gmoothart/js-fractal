h1. Mandelbrot viewer on html5 canvas.

Experimentations with modern browsers, html5, performance, and the beauty of fractals.

h1. Todo

* switch between Mandelbrot and julia sets easily
* use web workers with Transferable objects to speed it up (http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast)
* profile optimal number of workers
* add pretty color schemes
* switch to use BigDecimal intelligently when zooming in and numbers become close together
* animated transitions??
* more fractals! 3d fractals?
* use pushState() to track zoom level and allow history navigation.
* I think we can speed up the selection-drawing by only doing a clearRect() on the region we
  need to. That should eliminate the gap between mouse and rectangle when dragging.
* add "slow-mo" view, to show the Mandelbrot set being constructed one iteration at a time.
* draw Mandelbrot set off the UI thread, so it does not block loading of the whole page
* dashed selection line
* draw Julia set more accurately, cf. wikipedia
* do not do colorization in compute(), so that it is possible to change color schemes without re-computing
* fix rectangle-drawing code, sometimes it 'sticks' and does not work
* make zoom do something sensible when there is no selection
