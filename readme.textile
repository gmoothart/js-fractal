h1. Mandelbrot viewer on html5 canvas.

Experimentations with modern browsers, html5, performance, and the beauty of fractals.

h1. Todo

* Make it work
* show julia set on mouseover in a preview window, switch between Mandelbrot and julia sets easily
* use web workers with ArrayBuffer to speed it up (http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/09/Workers-ArrayBuffer)
* use web workers with Transferable objects to speed it up even more (http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast)
* profile optimal number of workers
* color scheme(s)
* zooming in - draw selection rectangle, update view.
* allow adjusting of iterations (or do it automatically on zoom?)
* switch to use BigDecimal intelligently when zooming in and numbers become close together
* animated transitions??
* more fractals! 3d fractals?
